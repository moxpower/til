# What are containers?

Containers are abstracting applications from the physical platform, allowing you to move them around from platform to platform.

# They can isolate apps

> The Linux kernel, which is in the container, allows for resource isolation (CPU, memory, I/O, network, and so on) and doesn't require starting any virtual machines.

> Docker also provides namespaces to completely isolate an application's view of the operating environment, including process trees, network, user IDs, and file systems.
