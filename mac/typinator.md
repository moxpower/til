# Turn on Typinator

The program (or the version that I have of it) points to the wrong location. 


It can be found: 

 - System Preferences
     + Security & Privacy
         * Accessibility
         

And then click "Allow the apps below to control your computer." And make sure "Typinator" is checked.
